                <h3>What is Alpha-Phonics?</h3>
                <p>Alpha-Phonics is a complete phonics reading instruction designed by Samuel L. Blumenfeld for little beginners, but is regularly used by all ages to learn improve reading. It is complete; nothing else is needed. Anyone who can read can teach anyone to read with it.</p>
                <p>Alpha-Phonics is an effective, step-by-step program that has taught countless homeschooled children to read, including older struggling readers, dyslexic students, and others. As a stand-alone program or supplement, Alpha-Phonics' systematic phonetic approach will help students build a logical framework for English reading</p><br>
                <h3>Samuel L. Blumenfeld</h3>
                <p>Sam Blumenfeld published ten books on education in America. He spent much of his career investigating the declne in American literacy and the reason for the high rate of learning disabilities in American childern. Mr. Blumenfeld has taught in schools and tutored privately, developing his own system of intensive phonics. Alpha-Phonics is the result of his research. "I wanted to create an effective, inexpensive and uncomplicated reading instruction program that could be used as widely as possible to help solve America's reading problem."</p><br>

                        <p>The alphabet is a tremndously exciting invention based on a great discovery: that all of human language is composed of a small number of irreducible speech sounds. In teaching the alphabet, you can convey to your student the excitement of this great discovery and the marvelous invention based on it.</p>

                        <p>Writing is an important part of learning to read. But how should you teach the learner to write? The learner should draw the letters of the alphabet when learning the letters in isolation. Once words are being read, the learner should be taught to write them in cursive script.</p>
