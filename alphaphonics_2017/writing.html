                    <h3>Suggestions on Writing Instruction</h3>
                    <p>Writing is an important part of learning to read. But how should you teach the learner to write? The learner should draw the letters of the alphabet when learning the letters in isolation. Once words are being read, the learner should be taught to write them in cursive script.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cursive helps a child learn to read. With the prevalent ball-and-stick method, it is very easy for the learner to confuse <em>b's</em> and <em>d's</em>. But with cursive, a <em>b</em> starts like an <em>l</em> as in <em>lead</em>, and a <em>d</em> starts like an <em>a</em>. The distinction that is made in writing the letters in cursive carries over to the reading process.</p>
                    
                    <p>In addition, in writing print script, the letters will be all over the page, sometimes written from left to right and sometimes from right to left. In cursive, where all the letters are joined, the student learns directional discipline because the letters must be joined from left to right. This helps in learning to spell, for how the letters join with one another creates habits of hand movement that automatically aid the spelling process.</p>
                    
                    <p>Of course, the learner should also be taught to print. This can easily be done after the learner has developed a good cursive handwriting.</p><br>
                    
                    <h3>Cursive First</h3>
                    
                    <p>The reason a child should be taught cursive first is that learning to print first may prevent a learner from developing a good cursive handwriting. However, if you learn to write cursive first, you can always learn to print later very nicely. In other words, learning cursive first does not prevent the development of a good printing style, while print first will create fixed writing habits that will prevent the development of a good cursive script.</p><br>
                    
                    <h3>The Benefits of Cursive for the Left-Handed Learner</h3>
                    
                    <p>Another important benefit of learning cursive first is if the learner is left-handed. A right-handed writer tilts the paper counter-clockwise in order to give one's handwriting the proper slant. With the left-handed learner, the paper must be tilted in an extreme clockwise position so that the student can write from bottom up. If the paper is not tilted to the right, the left-handed student may want to use the hook form of writing. This usually happens when the learner is taught ball-and-stick method first with the paper in a straight up position.</p>
